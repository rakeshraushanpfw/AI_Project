Tackling Bias and Misinformation in Healthcare

AI-Powered Prescription Safety and Fairness System

📌 Overview

This project aims to develop an AI system that assists doctors and pharmacists in preventing medication errors while ensuring fairness and accuracy in treatment. The AI model cross-checks prescriptions, detects potential biases in healthcare recommendations, and validates information against trusted medical guidelines.

🚀 Key Features

Medication Error Prevention – AI cross-checks prescriptions with patient history and known drug interactions.

Bias Detection & Fairness – Analyzes AI recommendations across different demographic groups to ensure equitable treatment.

Misinformation Detection – Validates AI-generated prescriptions against verified medical sources.

📂 Project Components

1️⃣ Data Sources

The AI model is trained using multiple healthcare datasets:

Network of Patient Safety Databases (NPSD) – Real-life medication error reports.

FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) – Tracks drug interactions and side effects.

MIMIC-III – Hospital records with patient prescriptions and outcomes.

DrugBank – Scientific data on drug interactions.

CDC Adverse Drug Events Data – Emergency visits related to medication errors.

2️⃣ Methodology

📌 Data Preparation – Standardizes, cleans, and anonymizes patient data.

📌 Model Development – Uses a RandomForestClassifier to predict medication correctness.

📌 Bias & Fairness Analysis – Evaluates accuracy across demographic groups.

📌 Misinformation Detection – Compares AI recommendations with trusted sources.

📌 Performance Evaluation – Measures accuracy, fairness, and trustworthiness.

🔧 Installation & Dependencies
